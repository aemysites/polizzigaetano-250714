Private Medical Insurance You can use your private medical insurance to cover treatments at Nuffield Health hospitals, giving you access to quality care with reduced waiting times. Considering private medical insurance? Usay Compare\u2019s expert advisers can help you find a plan that fits your needs and budget. Read more below. Paying with private medical insurance? Looking for private medical insurance? Paying for your treatment via medical insurance If you are paying for your procedure with medical insurance, then you need to liaise closely with your insurance provider throughout your treatment. You should be aware of the terms and conditions of your policy and let us know if there are any limitations. When you attend the hospital for treatment, please make sure you bring the following: Medical insurance registration documents Completed claim form/proof of pre-authorisation by your medical insurer. GP medical insurance claim sign-off Make sure that your claim form has been signed by your GP and, if required, by your insurance policy provider. In order to meet the admission requirements of many insurance companies, we may need you to provide the date when your symptoms first developed and the date you subsequently visited your GP. How to manage your medical treatment invoice We have an arrangement with many insurance companies that allows us to send your invoice to them electronically. However, at the end of your stay you may receive an invoice for treatment which, together with any consultant bills, should be forwarded to your insurance company. Private medical treatment payment considerations If you don\u2019t have all your insurance details with you when you first come into hospital for treatment, you may be asked to settle your account in full before leaving. As part of your treatment, and to ensure we can support you as quickly and smoothly as we can, we will need to take a swipe of your bank card before your procedure. We won\u2019t take any money without your prior knowledge and will only process information in compliance with our data privacy policy. This is necessary to proceed with your treatment. Treatment could be refused if card details aren\u2019t provided. Additional costs resulting from your stay Additional costs for any extras, such as telephone calls, newspapers and magazines and visitor meals, will be invoiced and must be paid when you leave the hospital. We are happy to answer any questions and help you understand the financial aspect of your treatment. Please note It is possible that you may have an excess on your policy or some charges may not be settled by your insurer or third party. It is Nuffield Health\u2019s policy to request card details as part of the booking process. Your credit/debit card details will only be used to secure payment in the event of any shortfall by your Insurer and you will be notified of the shortfall amount by the hospital. Looking for private medical insurance? As part of our purpose to build a healthier nation, Nuffield Health is delighted to recommend Usay Compare\u2019s free comparison service for private medical insurance . Private medical insurance can be confusing. Usay Compare have answered some common questions below to help. What is private medical insurance? Private medical insurance (or PMI) is a policy that covers the costs and provides access to private medical treatment. When you take out a policy, you and the insurer agree that, should you fall ill or suffer an injury, the policy will attempt to return you to the same level of health you had when you took it out. A private medical insurance policy doesn\u2019t pay out a lump sum \u2013 instead, it usually pays directly for diagnostics and treatment at a private hospital, like Nuffield Health. It\u2019s also worth noting that all policies will require you to be registered with an NHS GP. What are the benefits of private medical care? Health insurance is designed to complement NHS treatment. Benefits of private medical insurance include: Easier access to GP appointments Quicker access to diagnostics Access to a large range of consultants and hospitals. Nuffield Health hospitals offer some incredible benefits to patients, for example: State-of-the-art facilities and private en suite rooms Consultant-led treatment A team of dedicated and experienced nurses.

What is a pre-existing condition in private medical insurance and can I get cover? While the term \u2018pre-existing condition\u2019 is somewhat of an umbrella term, it generally refers to any form of medical condition or injury that you had prior to obtaining (or applying for) private health insurance. These can include chronic conditions such as asthma, arthritis, and diabetes, as well as long-term conditions such cancer, HIV and AIDS. Long NHS waiting lists and cancelled or delayed procedures are a common motivation for initial enquiries into health insurance. Depending on the condition, it is unlikely it will be covered on your plan. Although, if you have a pre-existing condition, speak to one of Usay Compare\u2019s expert advisers as different underwriting options may suit your needs.
